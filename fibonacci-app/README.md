## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the generation of a Fibonacci series, a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It's a simple yet powerful concept used in various programming and mathematical problems.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase how a Fibonacci series can be generated using Python. It serves as an educational tool for those learning programming and algorithmic thinking.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Python 3.x is recommended for compatibility. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. **Download the Project**: Clone or download this project to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the project.

### Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```

or if your system requires:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This command runs the `main.py` file, which in turn generates and prints a Fibonacci series of a predefined length set to 10.

### Understanding the Files

- **`fibonacci.py`**: This file contains the `generate_fibonacci` function responsible for generating the Fibonacci series. It accepts an integer `n` as an argument, which determines the length of the series to be generated.

- **`main.py`**: This is the entry point of the application. It imports and calls the `generate_fibonacci` function from `fibonacci.py`, demonstrating the generation of the Fibonacci series.

### Modifying the Series Length

To generate a Fibonacci series of a different length, you can modify the `main.py` file. Find the line where `generate_fibonacci` is called and change the argument to your desired series length. For example, to generate a series of 10 numbers, you would modify it as follows:

```python
generate_fibonacci(10)
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple demonstration of generating a Fibonacci series using Python. It is intended as a learning tool for beginners in programming. Feel free to explore and modify the code to better understand how the Fibonacci series is generated and how Python functions work.
