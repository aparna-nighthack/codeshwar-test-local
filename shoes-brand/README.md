# Stride — Simple Shoe Brand Website

A minimal, responsive landing site for a shoe brand. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JS — no frameworks or external dependencies.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Everything is static; no build step is required.

## Customize

- Brand name: search for `Stride` in `index.html` and replace.
- Colors: tweak CSS variables in `styles.css` under `:root` (e.g., `--primary`, `--bg`).
- Products: edit the three product cards in the `#products` section of `index.html`.
- Links: update social/profile links in the footer.

## Structure

- `index.html` — markup and sections for Hero, Products, About, Contact.
- `styles.css` — theme, layout, and responsive rules.
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle, smooth scroll, mock newsletter submit.

## Notes

- The newsletter form is a demo only. Connect it to your backend or a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms to collect submissions.
- Images are placeholders (emoji/blocks). Replace with real product images as needed.
